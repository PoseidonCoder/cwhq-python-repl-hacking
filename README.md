# CWHQ Python REPL

A Python REPL for the kids at CWHQ. Built with [jQueryTerminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/) and [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide).

## Installation

It's just an HTML file, so download `index.html` to your machine and you're ready to go!

## Usage

It's a Python REPL, so use it like you would any other REPL. There's a live version running [here](https://daniel-schroeder-dev.github.io/cwhq-python-repl-hacking/) if you'd like to play around with it!

Here's me demonstrating a few of the basics:
