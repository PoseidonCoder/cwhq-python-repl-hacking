# CWHQ Python REPL

A Python REPL for the kids at CWHQ. Built with [jQueryTerminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/) and [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide).

## Installation

It's just an HTML file, so download `index.html` to your machine and you're ready to go!

## Usage

It's a Python REPL, so use it like you would any other REPL. Several things don't work yet, as documented below in [Issues](issues).

## Issues


1. The '' isn't showing up for strings returned from single-statement func calls.
2. Booleans are lowercase (true, false).
3. When you store an array in a variable and log it, it doesn't show up right.

I'm sure there are many more issues, so if you find one, please let me know!
